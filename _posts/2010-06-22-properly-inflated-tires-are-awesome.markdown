I noticed over the weekend while driving up to Davis that my tires looked little under-inflated, so I after filling up on gas this morning I properly inflated my tires. After doing so I realized the following:





  * California has a [sweet law](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/99-00/bill/asm/ab_0501-0550/ab_531_bill_19990930_chaptered.html) that says gas stations have to provide free air and water for your car if you purchase gas. Score!


  * As [President Obama said during the campaign](http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/4276844), filling up your tires can improve your fuel economy. My tires were about 8 PSI (front) and 13 PSI (rear) under-inflated - I was losing 10% of my fuel economy! _Dang - would I have been able to go another 35 miles before filling up if I had correctly inflated tires?_


  * I was surprised by the difference in ride quality after properly inflating my tires: over the weekend I noticed that I was dreading hitting potholes as it felt my teeth were going to take a beating (disclosure: I drive a [BMW 3 series with sporty tires](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series_(E46))). After filling them today the ride was amazingly smooth!


So 3 wins today for filling the air in my tires, and it took me less than 5 minutes. Why don't I do this more often?!
