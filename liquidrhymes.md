**Why the Name Liquid Rhymes?**

When it came to trying to find a name for this blog the first thing I did, unfortunately, was to go look for a domain name. I say unfortunately because it sucks to have to restrict the name your blog/product/widget to available domains (because it's nearly impossible to find a decent available domain), but these days if a blog doesn't have it's own domain it's just ghetto. 

So after brainstorming a few names I found going to [godaddy.com](godaddy.com) and searching was becoming frustrating, as everything I came up was unfortunately unavailable in a .com/.net [tld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain). I had no desire to resort to .tv or some other ghetto tld, so I searched around for some other ways to come up with domain names. Perhaps if I couldn't come up with a name and then find an available domain I could find an available domain and have the name find me?

Luckily I stumbled upon an awesome site, [olddomains.net](http://www.olddomains.net/), which does exactly what I've described: it lists recently expired domains, so you can look for a domain you can snap up for 10 bucks. You can also do searches and list by letter, which is great if you're looking for a specific word in domain, or for a particular start to a domain name.

Okay, so now I've got a whole list of domains, which one works for me? I scanned the page looking for something good: [kaboogie.com](http://olddomains.net/com/kaboogie/) - no, not really my style; [novelbook.info](http://olddomains.net/info/novelbook/) - hmm, .info sucks too; [muslimtube.net](http://olddomains.net/net/muslimtube/) - hey, there is a business idea. And then: [liquidrhymes.com](http://olddomains.net/com/liquidrhymes/) - hey, that's pretty good!

When I was in growing up in Berkeley my friends and I fashioned ourselves rappers. Granted, 2 white guys and a hapa aren't exactly a traditional rap group (this was before [Eminem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem), so our white rappers were [Vanilla Ice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp-is6S_b_g) and the white dude from 3rd bass, above). We called ourselves the Wolf Tribe (I was **Lord Ras**), and we kicked rhymes about our experiences growing up in Berkeley. Anyway, the point here is that rap has always played an important part of my life, and rhymes are the key building block of rapping and freestyling. And liquid? Well, that's a great word - it sounds good, and has a [great meaning](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liquid):
