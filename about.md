![Simon with Leonard's Truly Awesome Malasadas](/assets/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/simon.jpg)

I’m a 30-something technology guy living in San Francisco’s [Mission District](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_District,_San_Francisco). I’m from [Berkeley, California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California) (which some people believe is the most liberal place ever), and I went to school at [UC Santa Barbara](http://www.ucsb.edu/) (UCSB), where I studied computer science with a minor in awesome sunshine.

I moved back to the bay area after I graduated from UCSB, and have been working in the valley for internet companies ever since.

This blog is where I write about all of my interests: technology, business, politics, what's hot on TV, sports, or whatever comes to mind.

Here is where else you can find me:
